        Outside of school, my main interest is also the topic which I&apos;m majoring in: computer
        science. My passion lies specifically in data analysis and machine learning, two related topics
        which I have spent time pursuing over my past four years in high school. <BR></BR>
        I have now had three self-sought internships which all deal with these subjects under different
        light. While they all share a common theme, chemical engineering, I understand the
        interdisciplinary nature of searching for and drawing conclusions from trends in data and am
        eager to learn other ways in which my skill set can be applied. <BR></BR>
        I&apos;m very familiar with python and spend time outside of school working on small projects,
        motivated by the fact that I will be able to apply my passion professionally. While I am
        currently studying computer science I do not have tunnel vision and am interested in learning
        what it takes to run a company. I aim to become a high-tier data analyst and plan to one day
        create a startup. <BR></BR>
